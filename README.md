# Python_Robotic3DPrinterSimulation
This script is for the simulation of a robotic 3D printer that extrudes drops of material.<br\>
The position and velocity of each droplet are tracked; gravitational, electrical, and drag forces are calculated to compute the acceleration of the drops.
This is a school work project, the code is published here after the homework due ONLY for archive and disscussion.
