# Python_Robotic3DPrinterSimulation
*This is a school work project, the code is published here after the homework due ONLY for archive and disscussion.*

This script is for the simulation of a robotic 3D printer that extrudes drops of material.

The position and velocity of each droplet are tracked; gravitational, electrical, and drag forces are calculated to compute the acceleration of the drops.

*GA_1.py* and *GA_2.py* are for Genetic algorithm, and *main.py* is for the simulation.
